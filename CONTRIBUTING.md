# Contributing

I mean... if you want to that would  be great. Very work in progress. Pull requests are welcome.

## Pull Request Flow

This project subscribes to the typical [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) of branch, commit, pull request, commit, merge. 

## Pre-Commit Hooks

To keep code consistent and awesome (and avoid common mistakes) this project makes use of a [golang centric pre-commit hook](https://github.com/dnephin/pre-commit-golang). Install pre-commit from [pre-commit.com](http://pre-commit.com/) and install the hook with `pre-commit install`. Commit as usual and the amazingness just happens by default, ensuring commands like go-fmt and go-lint run on every commit.

## Code of Conduct

This does not need to be a whole thing but just be nice to each other. Toxic folks are not worth putting up with for a few lines of code. This is solely at my discretion.
